# Mastermind
I completed this project as a part of my Computer Science II class.
This was my first time with object oriented design as it was my first
project where I was given no starter code. In this project I was tasked
with creating a single player version of the game mastermind in which 
a player is tasked with guessing a "code" of 4 colors. The player gets
feedback only by learning if they had any guesses in the correct place
or any guesses correct but in the wrong place (similar to wordle).
